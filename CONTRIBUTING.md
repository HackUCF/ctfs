# Contributing

For Hack@UCF members contributing to this repository, plese follow the correct procedures prior to creating a pull request.

## File Format

Each Academic year has it's own directory. For example, the Fall 2018 through Summer 2019 Academic year is labelled as `2018-2019`.

For each individual competition, a separate directory should be made. Replace spaces with `_` and all lowercase. For example, Sunshine CTF 2018's directory is `sunshine_ctf_2018`.

In each competition, separate directories are made per challenge category. For example, Pwn challenges belong in a directory called `pwn`.

Each challenge has it's own directory as well. If a challenge is called "Now you see me" and it is a 200 point challenge, it's directory would be `now_you_see_me_200`.

In Summary, The directory for a challenge might look like: `sunshine_ctf_2018/pwn/hacker_name_50`

## Competition README

Each competition will have a README.md file. This file will contain information such as the organizing group of the CTF, the dates the competition took place, Hack@UCF's final standing, as well as a list of contributors to the writeups for this CTF.

## Challenge README

Each challenge will have its own README.md file. This file will contain information such as the point value of the challenge, the challenge summary as given (CTFd Description) along with information such as a target IP address and port. The following information will be the challenge writeup.

## Challenge Writeup

The Challenge writeup is part of the challenge's README.md file. This is where the majority of explainations, etc... will be located. The two options for posting a writeup are as follows:

1. Writeup left in the README.md file of the challenge
2. Link to the writeup located elsewhere (such as HackUCF.org)

Either way, we ask that all writeups posted to this repository be in good taste and include a thorough and full explaination of what was required to complete the challenge.
