# Hack@UCF CTF Writeups and Challenges

![Logo](https://hackucf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/carousel4_2.jpg)

## What is this?
This is a repository containing CTF Writeups for challenges completed and/or created by members of Hack@UCF, The Collegiate Cyber Defense Club @ UCF. We try to post here often with writeups with two purposes in mind:

1. We learn more by writing down what we have done and explaining it in depth.
2. We are able to help others in their quest to learn how to CTF.
