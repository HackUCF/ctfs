#### Description

Students tackle problems in a series of real-world scenarios modeling all sorts of computer security problems where, to succeed, they must demonstrate a profound understanding of the roles and ramifications of cyber security in these situations.

Because the challenges are designed to teach, CTF requires contestants to integrate concepts, develop skills and learn to hack as they go.
